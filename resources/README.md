# Resources

## Redux

- [Redux Docs](https://redux.js.org/docs/introduction/)
- [React-Redux tutorials](https://medium.com/coding-artist/practical-redux-chapter-1-core-concepts-f5a53f74505c)
    + These tutorials are very long. I used the first five chapters to set up the initial implementation of **Deep Turtle**.
    + For more information on actions, check out [Chapter 2](https://medium.com/coding-artist/redux-from-scratch-chapter-2-practicing-the-basics-a3f336e69739)
    + For more information on redux-middleware/redux-thunk check out [Chapter 5](https://medium.com/coding-artist/redux-from-scratch-chapter-5-implementing-middleware-533e201fc745)
- [Youtube video explaining Redux Structure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1w-oQ-i1XB8)
    + This video does a way better job than I did explaining Redux stores and their interaction with React components.

## React

- The React docs have a pretty clear [tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html) on how React/JSX syntax.
- This is a concise [tutorial by buildwithreact.com](http://buildwithreact.com/tutorial) which is split up into modules.
    + May be easier to get through than the Facebook React docs.
- Redux has a [Todo-list example](https://redux.js.org/docs/basics/ExampleTodoList.html) that shows how React and Redux interact
    + This is much shorter than the more Redux focused, multi-chapter, tutorial in the Redux resources
- [Material-UI-Next Docs](https://material-ui-next.com/)
    + These docs are awesome.  They not only have documentation on a bunch of pretty pre-built react components, but they are very clear on how to use the components.  If you understand the basics of React, the docs make it very easy to learn how to use components.
    + **Note:** DeepTurtle is currently using the latest implementation of Material-UI which is referred to as Material-UI-Next.  It is a much more flexible library, but is not compatible with the old version of components.  When looking at the docs, make sure you are at [material-ui-next.com](https://material-ui-next.com/) and NOT material-ui.com.
